# BLECode 
This aim of this framework is to to manage communication and read sensor data 
from BLE devices such as the Arduino Nicla Sense ME and compare with Simulink 
data in a real-time and offline mode. 

The project is developed in collaboration with the Mechatronics Laboratory at
the University of Bergamo.
